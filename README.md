To use the node implementation you must:
1) Download and install node.js and npm
2) Run "npm install locomotive -g" (you may have to run in sudo mode)
3) Run "npm install" in the actserver directory
4) Start the server with "lcm server
5) Launch the browser on localhost:3000

To test the Play implemntation:
